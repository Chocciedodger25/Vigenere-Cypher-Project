This was a summer project for my first year at University to see how much of what I was taught I understand. 

Overall I am happy with this, I was able to go away and learn about:
<li>Ascii table</li>
<li>The cypher itself</li> 
<li>Java UI</li> 

If I was to do this again I would add the exceptions to give dynamic error messages, and actually learn how to deploy in java.

Currently known bugs: 

<li>Using a special character in the key will cause an error of character not found in the key alphabet.</li>
<li>Clicking on the text field without typing or highlighting might cause the text to delete itself due to the program treating all text as placeholder text</li>

Things I would now do different:
I now know that rather then just doubling the alphabet to make sure it's not out of range, I can use (index+shitf_position)%25 to then get the index in the alphabet, saving memory.
