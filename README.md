This was a summer project for my first year at University to see how much of what I was taught I understand. 

Overall I am happy with this, I was able to go away and learn about:
Ascii table,
the cypher itself, 
Java UI. 

If I was to do this again I would add the exceptions to give dynamic error messages, and actually learn how to deply in java.

Currently known bugs: 
<br>
using a special character in the key will cause an error of character not found in the key alphabet.
<br>
Clicking on the text field without typing or highlighting might cause the text to delete itself due to the program treating all text as placeholder text
